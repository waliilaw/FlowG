# flowg: visual ai workflow builder for 0G

hey there! welcome to flowg, a game-changing visual workflow builder that leverages the power of 0g's decentralized ai operating system. we're building this for eth global, focusing on making ai workflow creation as easy as connecting lego blocks.

## what is flowg? ðŸ¤”

flowg is a drag-and-drop interface for building and deploying ai workflows on 0g's decentralized infrastructure. think of it as node-red meets ai, but fully decentralized and web3-native.

### core features 

- visual workflow builder with real-time preview
- drag-and-drop ai components powered by 0g compute
- decentralized storage integration with 0g storage
- on-chain workflow versioning using 0g da
- seamless deployment to 0g mainnet
- ai-assisted configuration suggestions

## why we built this 

building ai applications is hard. building decentralized ai applications is even harder. flowg makes it accessible to everyone - from developers to data scientists to business analysts.

### how it works 

1. **workflow creation**
   - drag nodes from the sidebar
   - connect them to create logic flows
   - configure each node with ai assistance

2. **node types**
   - ai compute nodes (text generation, image generation)
   - storage nodes (0g storage integration)
   - logic nodes (conditionals, loops)
   - input/output nodes
   - chain interaction nodes

3. **execution & deployment**
   - test workflows in the browser
   - version control with 0g da
   - one-click deployment to 0g mainnet

## tech stack ðŸ”§

- frontend: next.js + typescript
- workflow engine: custom implementation with 0g sdks
- state management: zustand
- visualization: @xyflow/react
- ai: 0g compute network
- storage: 0g storage
- data availability: 0g da
- smart contracts: 0g chain (evm compatible)

## potential growth areas 

### immediate roadmap
- ai-powered node suggestions
- workflow templates marketplace
- collaborative editing features
- advanced debugging tools
- workflow analytics dashboard

### future possibilities
1. **ai ecosystem expansion**
   - custom model integration
   - federated learning workflows
   - model fine-tuning interface
   - automated optimization

2. **developer tools**
   - sdk for custom node development
   - testing framework for workflows
   - ci/cd pipeline integration
   - monitoring and alerting

3. **enterprise features**
   - role-based access control
   - audit logging
   - compliance tools
   - enterprise slas

4. **community features**
   - workflow sharing marketplace
   - node template repository
   - community governance
   - bounty system for node development

## why 0g is perfect for this 

0g's decentralized ai operating system provides the exact infrastructure we need:

- **0g compute network**
  - decentralized ai inference
  - distributed training capabilities
  - pay-per-use pricing
  - low latency execution

- **0g storage**
  - decentralized data persistence
  - content-addressed storage
  - automatic replication
  - data integrity verification

- **0g da layer**
  - infinite scalability for workflow versions
  - immutable history
  - proof of existence
  - data availability guarantees

- **0g chain**
  - evm compatibility
  - smart contract deployment
  - transaction management
  - cross-chain integrations

## getting started 

1. clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waliilaw/flowg.git
   cd flowg
   ```

2. install dependencies:
   ```bash
